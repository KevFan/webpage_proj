PROJECT TITLE:
===========================
Web Devlopement Project 1


===========================
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
===========================
The purpose of this project is apply concepts learned from the module to date and create a user friendly static web page. 

For my webpage, I based the project on the history and developement of Sony PlayStation console system.


===========================
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
===========================
The project currently uses ejs templating, and as such would require the project to be hosted locally which supports this templating system (harp was used during the developement of this project), therefore an internet connection is required.

Also the website would not work correctly for the harp compile version unless it's been deployed, as referencing has been changed to absolute for deployment.


===========================
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
===========================
User should host the project locally through a platform that supports the ejs templating engine (such as harp). 

Alternatively if this project has been deployed, you can visit the project at
