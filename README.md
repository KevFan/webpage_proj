PROJECT TITLE:
--------------------------
Web Devlopement Project 1


PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
--------------------------
The purpose of this project is apply concepts learned from the module to date and create a user friendly static web page. 

For my webpage, I based the project on the history and developement of Sony PlayStation console system.

Image and information content are not owned by me but taken from websites such as wikipedia.


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
--------------------------
The project currently uses ejs templating, and as such would require the project to be hosted locally through an application that supports this templating system (harp was used during the developement of this project), therefore an internet connection is required.

Also the website would not work correctly for the harp compile version unless it's been deployed, as referencing has been changed to absolute for deployment.


USER INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------
User should host the project locally through a platform that supports the ejs templating engine (such as harp). 

Alternatively, this project has been deployed using surge, to the domain name:
kevfanwebproject.surge.sh

Note: Website is intended for use on a desktop - some functionality such as change in opacity on hover or pop up text on hover may not work as intended when viewed on a mobile system
